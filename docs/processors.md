# Processors

Processors are entities in a schema. They can have access to multiple properties.

Processors can be chained. 

There is also a processor dependencies recursion check.

Feel free to send us a feedback about processors you are missing.

## Limitations

As for now processor cannot process array fields. In future we will implement this feature.
